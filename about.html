  <div class="question">
    hey queenie, <br>why do you design?
  </div>
  <div class="bioanswer">
    because our world is tough to understand.
  </div>
  <div class="bio">
     When I was in Kindergarten, footage of China's ShenZhou Six blasting off caught my eye while the news played in my living room. From that point on, Iâ€™ve wanted to be an astronaut. As I pursued the goal, I couldn't help but focus on the number of disasters in space exploration caused by misuse and misinformation. So I asked myself, what can I do to alleviate that?
<br><br>
I chose Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo because of the opportunities in human factors psychology and its applications. I soon found the world of digital product design and how that can affect the world in many ways.
<br><br>
I'm also a huge advocate for the design community. I lead UW/UX - the University of Waterloo's first and only UX club, building the community through events and workshops, and direct content for UW Blueprint - a philanthropic club focused on building tech for non-profits.
<br><br>
Looking forward, I want to create solutions that help our world process complexity. I want to work in the geospacial industry designing for situational awareness in high-risk environments. It might be a lofty goal, but after all, even my five-year-old self imagined being among the stars.
