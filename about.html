    hey queenie, <br>why do you design?

  <div class="about">

  <div class="bioanswer">
    because our world is tough to understand.
</div>
  <div class="bio">
     When I was in Kindergarten, I'd replay China's ShenZhou Six blasting off over and over. Since then, Iâ€™ve wanted to be an astronaut. As I pursued the goal, I couldn't help but focus on the number of disasters in space exploration caused by misinformation. So I asked myself, what can I do to alleviate that?
<br><br>
I chose Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo because of the opportunities in human factors psychology and its applications, not knowing I'd stumble across digital product design.
<br><br>
I'm also a huge advocate for the design community. I lead UW/UX - the University of Waterloo's first and only UX club, connecting students to the industry through events and workshops.
<br><br>
Looking forward, I want to create solutions that help our world understand itself. I want to make complex tools not so complex anymore. It might be a lofty goal, but after all, even my five-year-old self imagined being among the stars.
