  <div class="question">
    hey queenie, <br>why do you design?
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    because our world is hard to understand.
  </div>
  <div class="bio">
    When I was five, footage of China's ShenZhou Six blasting off caught my eye while I was watching the news. From that point on, Iâ€™ve wanted to be an astronaut. However, as I pursued on, I couldn't help but focus on the number of disasters in space exploration caused by misuse or <b>misinformation</b>. So I asked myself, what can I do to alleviate that?
<br>
I chose Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo because of the opportunities in human factors psychology and its applications. I soon found the world of digital product design and how that can affect the world in many ways.
<br>
I'm also a huge advocate for the design community. I lead UW/UX, the University of Waterloo's first and only UX club, building the community through events and workshops. I also direct content for UW Blueprint, a philanthropic club focused on building tech for non-profits.
<br>
Looking forward, I want to create solutions that help people understand the information around them. I want to work in the geospacial industry designing for situational awareness in high-risk environments. It might be a lofty goal, but after all, but even my five-year-old self imagined being among the stars.
